## News
The Home Portal projet will be moved from sourceforge to here for the reason that it is very demanding to keep an executable installer up to date as the project has many build in executables and the user will receive the installation instructions through this page.

## Install on Linux
Under Dev

## Install on Windows

Due to the extensive executables needed to install home portal in windows such as modifying registry for the install, uninstall and applying plug and play, the installation process only by itself needs a substantial time only to be self-maintained. Therefore the user is suggested to install the xampp bundle and modify it accordingly to install Home Portal.
